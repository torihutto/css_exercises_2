Exercises CSS pt 2

1) a. Content Box Model
		total width=345px


   		total height=466px

   		The content-box: Width and height values apply to the element's content only. The padding and border are added to the outside of the box. That's because the default box sizing model is content-box, which applies an element's declared width to its content only, placing the padding and border outside the element's box. This effectively increases how much space the element takes up.







 b. Border Box Model

 	total width= 321px
    height:422px

    border-box:lets you put the padding and border inside of the box. So if you had an element's width at 200px and a border of 10px and a padding of 5px on the right and left sides, you'd add 5 + 10 +200 +10 + 5= 230px total width.
	border-boxes push the padding and borders inside the element's box, rather than outside of the content--like the content box.
